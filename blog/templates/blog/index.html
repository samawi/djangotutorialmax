                            There's nothing like the views you get when hiking in the mountains! And I wasn't even
                            prepared for what happened whilst I was enjoying the view!

    <p>
        I love programming and I love helping others and I enjoy exploring new technologies in general!

        My goal is to keep on growing as a developer - and if I could help you do the same, I would be very happy!
